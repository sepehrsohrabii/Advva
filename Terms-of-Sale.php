                <p>By purchasing any Merchant Offering, Product or participating in other available programs via the Site, you agree to the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the Terms of Sale specified below.</p><p><strong>(a) In General</strong></p>
                <p>Descriptions of the Merchant Offerings and Products advertised on the Site are provided by the Merchant or other referenced third parties. Advva does not investigate or vet Merchants. Advva is not responsible for any claims associated with the description of the Merchant Offerings or Products. Pricing relating to certain Merchant Offerings, Products, and other available programs on the Site may change at any time in Advva’s sole discretion without notice.</p>
                <p>A Merchant may advertise goods, services or experiences on the Site, or with respect to Products, supply products to Advva, that require Merchant to have an up-to-date regulatory authorization, license, or certification. Advva does not verify, validate, or collect evidence of any regulatory authorization, license or certification from any Merchant (including, without limitation, Health &amp; Fitness and Beauty &amp; Spa Merchants). You should make whatever investigation you deem necessary or appropriate before purchasing any Merchant Offering or Product to determine whether: (i) Merchant is qualified to provide the advertised good or perform the advertised service; or (ii) the Product is of the care and quality required. Merchant is solely responsible for the care and quality of the goods and services being provided or the care and quality of the Products.</p>
                <p>Advva is not a health or wellness provider and does not, will not, and cannot refer, recommend, or endorse any specific professional services, products, or procedures that are advertised on the Site. The Site is not a substitute for professional advice, including, without limitation, medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a health condition. Never neglect to seek out or delay or disregard professional advice relating to your health because of something you have read on the Site.</p>
                <p>Advva may, in its sole discretion, verify a user’s identity prior to processing a purchase. Advva may also refuse to process a purchase, may cancel a purchase, or may limit quantities, shipment, or food delivery to particular addresses, as reasonably deemed necessary, to comply with applicable law or to respond to a case of misrepresentation, fraud or known or potential violations of the law or these Terms of Use. Refunds for cancelled orders may be issued where appropriate.</p>
                <p>If an offer becomes unavailable between ordering and processing, Advva will either cancel or not process the order and will notify you by email.</p><p>Advva does not guarantee that it offers best available rates or prices and does not guarantee against pricing errors. Advva reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to not process or to cancel any orders placed, including, without limitation, if the price was incorrectly posted on the Site. If this occurs, Advva will attempt to notify you by email. In addition, Advva reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to correct any error in the stated retail price of the Merchant Offering or Product.</p><p>Advva’s standard refund policies are located&nbsp;here.</p><p><strong>(b) Merchant Offerings</strong></p><p>(i) Vouchers</p><p>Vouchers are distributed by either AMS or Advva and are redeemable for certain goods, services or experiences offered by, or facilitated through, the Merchant identified on the Voucher. The Merchant is solely responsible for redeeming the Voucher. Furthermore, the Merchant is fully and solely responsible for the care and quality of all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs (“Liabilities”) it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Voucher or not. You waive and release Advva and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any Liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a Voucher or the goods, services or experiences a Merchant provides in connection with the Voucher.</p><p>By purchasing, viewing a mobile version, printing, accepting, using or attempting to use any Voucher, you agree specifically to the terms on the Voucher and any additional deal-specific terms advertised in connection with and on the Voucher at the time of purchase, the Terms of Use and these Terms of Sale. These rules apply to all Vouchers that we make available, unless otherwise disclosed in connection with the purchase of a particular Voucher, and except as otherwise required by law. In the event of a conflict between these rules and the terms advertised in connection with and on the Voucher at the time of purchase, the terms advertised in connection with and on the Voucher at the time of purchase&nbsp;will control. Any attempt to redeem a Voucher in violation of these Terms of Use (including, without limitation, the Terms of Sale) will render the Voucher void.</p><p>The Merchant is the sole issuer of the Voucher. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash, unless required by law. Unauthorized or unlawful reproduction, resale, modification, or trade of Vouchers is prohibited. Pricing relating to certain Merchant Offerings and Products on the Site may change at any time in Advva’s discretion, without notice.</p><p>The Merchant is solely responsible for the sale and shipment of alcoholic beverages. Any offer that features alcohol will contain information about shipping and other restrictions. Visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://gr.pn/1kboxNX">Buying FAQ</a>&nbsp;for information about Advva’s tax policies and other&nbsp;frequently asked questions about Advva’s shipping policies.</p><ul><li>Additional terms applicable to traditional Vouchers. A traditional Voucher is any Voucher other than a Coupon, ticket, a Local Pick-Up Voucher (described below), or a Voucher redeemable for ticketed events (e.g., AdvvaLive and other ticketed event vouchers), or a Voucher redeemable for goods and services that has been scheduled for a specific date and time (i.e., a Booking). A traditional Voucher has two separate values: (i) the amount paid and (ii) the promotional value. The promotional value is the additional value beyond the amount paid. For example, if you pay $20 for a Voucher that entitles you to $50 of goods, services, or experiences from a Merchant, the amount paid is $20 (this amount does not expire until it is used or is refunded) and the promotional value is $30 (this amount expires on the date stated on the Voucher unless expiration of the promotional value is prohibited by law). The Merchant is responsible for permitting you to redeem the Voucher for at least the amount paid, even after the promotional value has expired. The amount paid WILL NEVER EXPIRE. The promotional value of a traditional Voucher may not be combined with other offers and no portion of its value is intended to cover tax or gratuity. Traditional Vouchers are not reloadable, meaning that the amount paid of the Voucher cannot be increased, but are fully transferrable.</li></ul><ul><li>Additional terms for Tickets and Admission Vouchers</li></ul><ul><li>Tickets and Admission Vouchers. Some Vouchers are redeemable for a ticket for admission, or may be used as a ticket for admission, to a specific event at a named venue. A-Pass tickets (which are Advva-branded admission Vouchers), tickets shipped or emailed directly from a Merchant, AdvvaLive Vouchers, and certain other Vouchers redeemable for tickets or admission to events (collectively, “Tickets and Admission Vouchers”) have no value once the event date and time has passed. Tickets and Admission Vouchers are&nbsp;final sale&nbsp;and&nbsp;non-refundable, subject to the Extraordinary Event Policy, unless otherwise stated. Tickets and Admission Vouchers do not include any applicable gratuity. Unless a specific exception is made, Tickets and Admission Vouchers are not eligible for upgrades and are not transferable. Certain resale premiums and restrictions may apply. Tickets and Admission Vouchers obtained from unauthorized sources may be lost, stolen, or counterfeit, and if so are void.</li></ul><ul><li>Venues and Events. Opening acts, as well as individual performers, are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice or recourse by you. Venues may search you as a condition of admission and ban or restrict certain items from being brought to the event and impose other rules on ticket-holders. You agree to all such rules and conditions and waive any related claims that may arise in conjunction with their imposition or execution. A ticket is a revocable license and admission may be refused for violation of the venue’s rules without refund, or for any or no reason upon refunding the amount paid. You voluntarily assume all risks and danger incidental to any event for which any Tickets and Admission Vouchers are issued, whether occurring before, during or after the event, and you waive any claims for personal injury or death against Advva, the venue, the issuer of the Tickets and Admission Vouchers, and all of their respective affiliates, agents, officers, directors, owners, and employees on behalf of yourself and any accompanying minor. You agree not to record or transmit or aid in recording or transmitting, any description, account, picture or reproduction of any event for which you purchase Tickets and Admission Vouchers. You agree that any event for which you purchase Tickets and Admission Vouchers is a public event, that your appearance and actions inside and outside the venue where the event occurs are public in nature and that you have no expectation of privacy with regard to your actions or conduct at the event.</li></ul><ul><li>Trade-In Program</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The following terms and conditions apply to our trade-in program. By participating in the trade-in program, you agree to the terms and conditions below. Certain Vouchers may be eligible for the trade-in program and you must have an account to participate. As part of the program, you may trade-in an eligible Voucher in your account for Advva Bucks credit equal to the amount paid for the Voucher or another amount specified by Advva. Subject to the program terms outlined below, you can then use these Advva Bucks to purchase another Voucher. For a Voucher to be eligible for trade-in:</p><ul><li>Advva, in its sole discretion, must designate the Voucher as eligible.</li><li>The code on the Voucher must have not been viewed or the Voucher must have not been redeemed.</li><li>The trade-in must occur either (a) between purchase and the two (2) weeks after the promotional value expiration date, or (b) only during the two (2) weeks after the promotional value expiration date, or (c) the time period otherwise designated by Advva.</li></ul><p>After you select the Voucher to trade-in, your Advva Bucks credit will be deposited in your account or associated with your account as a pending credit, at Advva’s sole discretion. You may have the option of selecting more than one eligible Voucher for trade-in. If you have this option, the credit associated with each Voucher will be added together for a total Advva Bucks credit. Once the Advva Bucks credit is deposited in your account or is pending, you will have twenty-four (24) hours or another time period otherwise designated by Advva (“Trade-In Window”) to use the Advva Bucks credit to purchase another Voucher-based Merchant Offering. Any Voucher you select for trade-in is ineligible for redemption during the Trade-In Window. If you do not use the Advva Bucks credit during the Trade-In Window, and the end of the Trade-In Window is&nbsp;before&nbsp;the promotional value expiration date, the amount paid and promotional value of the Voucher will be restored. If you do not use the Advva Bucks credit during the Trade-In Window, and the end of the Trade-In Window is&nbsp;after&nbsp;the promotional value expiration date, only the amount paid for the Voucher will be restored. Once the applicable value of the Voucher is restored, the Advva Bucks credit will be removed from your Advva account. For pending Advva Bucks credit, Advva will only deposit the credit to your account and apply it when you complete the purchase of another Voucher. If you use some, but not all, of the Advva Bucks 
                    credit you receive during the Trade-In Window, the Advva Bucks credit not used will remain in your account and will be treated the same as Advva Bucks issued as part of a refund. There will be no value restored to those Vouchers.</p><p>(ii) Getaways</p><p>Getaways that you purchase through the Site are subject to the terms below:</p><ul><li>Getaways Flash Deals. A Advva Getaways Flash Deal is a Advva-facilitated hotel or travel package at a named Merchant available for purchase for a limited period of time (“Getaways Flash Deal”). Unless otherwise specified, a Getaways Flash Deal is non-transferrable. A Getaways Flash Deal may not be sold, auctioned, or bartered. Cancellations to Getaways Flash Deals may only be made through Advva until the deadline specified in connection with the Getaways Flash Deal. Cancellations to any Getaways Flash Deal after the cancellation deadline and modifications to the traveler’s name are at the discretion of the Merchant and not Advva. Advva does not facilitate and is not liable for any special requests, which may be accommodated directly with the Merchant prior to check-in at the Merchant’s discretion. Advva strongly encourages all travelers to obtain independent travel insurance. You agree to abide by any additional rules and restrictions that the Merchant may require and violation of such additional rules and restrictions may result in additional charges and/or the cancellation of your Getaways Flash Deal.</li></ul><ul><li>There are two types of Getaways Flash Deals:</li></ul><ul><li>A Getaways Voucher is a voucher for a specified length of stay and room type that may be booked for a pre-defined range of dates at a named Merchant property (“Getaways Voucher”). The promotional value of a Getaways Voucher will EXPIRE on the book by date specified on the face of the Getaways Voucher, unless prohibited by law. The promotional value cannot be combined with other offers. Travel must be booked by the book-by-date by directly contacting the Merchant, and all travel must be completed by the travel by date specified on the Getaways Voucher. The amount paid WILL NEVER EXPIRE. After the promotional value has expired, the Merchant is responsible for permitting you to redeem the Getaways Voucher for at least the amount paid towards the advertised experience of the Getaways Flash Deal. Getaways Vouchers are not valid for existing reservations or for group bookings. Getaways Vouchers are not reloadable. Getaways Vouchers are fully transferable. Unless otherwise specified, Getaways Vouchers exclude all taxes and any other traveler costs including, without limitation, travel insurance, incidentals, service charges, gratuities or expenses due to special requests or add-ons.</li></ul><ul><li>A Getaways booking is a travel reservation for a specific check-in date, length of stay, and room type at a named Merchant property (“Getaways Bookings”). Getaways Bookings have no value once the check-in date has passed. Amounts displayed in the “Taxes and Fees” line include tax that Advva collects as an agent on behalf of the Merchant. Such taxes are transferred to the Merchant for payment to the appropriate taxing authority. In addition, the “Taxes and Fees” line may include a fee we charge and retain in exchange for the services we provide in facilitating your transaction with the Merchant. Our service fees vary based on the amount and type of Getaways Bookings. Advva will apply tax to the service fee, where applicable. You may also incur other charges collected by Advva at check-out which will be noted in the Getaways Flash Deal terms such as, but not limited to, hotel resort fees, cleaning fees, parking fees, and/or pet fees. Unless otherwise specified, Getaways Bookings expressly exclude any other traveler costs including, without limitation, travel insurance, incidentals, service charges, gratuities or expenses due to special requests or add-ons.</li></ul><ul><li>Getaways Market Pick hotels. A Getaways Market Pick hotel is a reservation for a specific check-in date, length of stay, and room type at a named Merchant property (“Getaways Market Pick hotel”). Getaways Market Pick hotels are non-transferrable, may not be sold, auctioned, or bartered, and have no value once the check-in date has passed. Unless otherwise specified, Getaways Market Pick hotels include tax recovery charges and service fees and expressly exclude any other traveler costs including, without limitation, travel insurance, incidentals, service charges, gratuities or expenses due to special requests or add-ons. The tax recovery charge is assessed to recover the amount we pay to the merchant in connection with your reservation for sales and use, occupancy room tax, excise tax, value added and other similar taxes, and the balance of the additional amount is a service fee we charge in connection with handling your reservation. Advva does not facilitate and is not liable for any special requests, which may be accommodated directly with the Merchant prior to check-in at the Merchant’s discretion. Cancellations to Getaways Market Pick hotels may only be made through Advva until the deadline specified in connection with the Getaways Market Pick hotel. Cancellations to any Getaways Market Pick hotel after the cancellation deadline are at the discretion of the Merchant and not Advva. Advva strongly encourages all travelers to obtain independent travel insurance. You agree to abide by any additional rules and restrictions that the Merchant may require, and violation of such additional rules and restrictions may result in additional charges and the cancellation of your Getaways Market Pick hotel.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(iii) Merchant Products</p><p>Through the Site, certain Merchants allow you to purchase various products directly from the Merchant. Terms and conditions regarding shipping, delivery, and returns will vary by Merchant and will be stated in the Merchant’s deal terms. Charges for delivery and applicable sales taxes will be added at checkout. Once you click the “Buy” button, Advva will notify the Merchant of your requested order. Your purchase is not complete until you receive an email from Advva confirming whether or not the Merchant has accepted your order.&nbsp;Merchant is solely responsible for all Merchant Products purchased through the Site.</p><p>(iv) Coupons</p><p>Coupons are offered by Merchants to consumers throughout the Site, including, without limitation, a portion of the Site dedicated to Coupons. Coupons are subject to the terms and conditions as specified by the Merchant. By obtaining or purchasing a Coupon through the Site, you acquire the right to redeem the Coupon with the Merchant. Any service fee retained by Advva from the sale of a Coupon, if applicable, is compensation to Advva for marketing, promoting, advertising, and distributing the Coupons on behalf of the Merchant. As the issuer of the Coupon, the Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all Liabilities, caused in whole or in part by the Merchant, as well as for any Liabilities arising from any regulatory action. Coupons have no cash or residual value. Advva does not make any warranty in relation to the Coupons, including, without limitation, their validity and/or value. Advva is not a party to any transaction that the Merchant and you may enter into as a result of you purchasing any Coupon.</p><p>(v) Merchant Gift Cards</p><p>Merchant Gift Cards are offered by Merchants to consumers subject to the terms and conditions specified by the Merchant on the face of the Merchant Gift Card.

Your information will be provided to Third-Party Food Companies via a token and Third-Party Food Companies will charge your credit card for these orders.&nbsp;Your use of the Site, and your relationship with Advva, is governed by the&nbsp;Advva Terms of Use.

The&nbsp;terms and conditions of each Third-Party Food Company&nbsp;apply solely to your relationship with Third-Party Food Companies for those services, which you can locate on their websites directly.&nbsp;Notwithstanding the reference herein to the Third-Party Food Companies Terms, the Third-Party Food Companies Terms are not part of the Advva Terms of Use.</p><p>&nbsp;(vii) Bookings</p><p>Through the Site, certain Merchants allow you to schedule use of your Voucher on a specific date and time (i.e., a Booking), and make any additional payments through the Site. Any additional charges that may be charged after the Booking, such as applicable gratuity, will be disclosed in connection with the Booking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Booking is not complete until you receive confirmation from Advva that the Booking is confirmed. Any scheduling restrictions, such as maximum group size or time and 
                        date availability, will be specified in connection with the Booking. The Merchant is solely responsible for honoring any booking that is not booked through the Site and associated discounts, as well as for any of Merchant’s customer loyalty programs. A Booking may not be sold, auctioned, or bartered. Additionally, the Merchant is solely responsible for the care and quality of all goods and services it provides to you. Advva does not facilitate nor is it liable for any special requests that the Merchant may accommodate at its discretion.

Restrictions regarding cancellation or rescheduling deadlines and availability of appointments may vary by Merchant and will be no less than 24 hours before your scheduled Booking, unless stated otherwise in connection with the Booking. If you do not cancel or reschedule your Booking before such cancellation or rescheduling deadline, your Voucher will be redeemed after such deadline passes.
