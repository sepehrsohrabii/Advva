While we use reasonable efforts to keep the Site and your account accessible, the Site and/or your account may be unavailable from time to time.

                <h5>5. Modification</h5>
                <p>We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or modify any part of these Terms of Use in our sole discretion.

If you do not agree to the changes, you may close your account and you should not use the Site or any services offered through the Site after the effective date of the changes.

Upon termination, the provisions of these Terms of Use that are, by their nature, intended to survive termination (e.g., any disclaimers, all limitations of liability, and all indemnities) shall survive.

                <h5>24. Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement</h5>

Except as specifically stated herein, any dispute or claim between you and Advva Deals and/or its subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or any of their respective members, officers, directors, and employees (all such entities collectively referred to herein as the “Advva Deals Entities”) arising out of, relating in any way to, or in connection with the Terms of Use, the Site or your use of the Site, your Personal Information, or any Products or Merchant Offerings (“Dispute(s)”) shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration; except that you may bring a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court. By virtue of this Dispute Agreement (defined below), you and Advva Deals are each giving up the right to go to court and have a Dispute heard by a judge or jury (except as otherwise set forth in this Section 24(a) or Section 24(d)).&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The provisions of this Section 24 shall constitute your and Advva Deals’ written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“<strong>Dispute Agreement</strong>”). The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules, including, without limitation, the AAA’s Consumer-Arbitration Rules, available at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">ADR Consumer site.</a>&nbsp;The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award, if appropriate.</p>
                <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must submit the Dispute by utilizing the forms available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">ADR Consumer site</a>, and simultaneously sending a copy of the completed form to the following address:&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Now Law Firm, APLC&nbsp; 6345 Balboa Blvd Bldg 3 Ste 257, Encino, CA 91316</p>
                <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. Advva Deals will reimburse those fees for Disputes totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. Likewise, Advva Deals will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request, and/or the arbitrator determines, that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. In addition, you hereby unconditionally agree that (1) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms of Use and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the Site; (2) the arbitrator shall apply California law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (3) in the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, you and the applicable Advva Deals Entity(ies) shall agree to, or a court shall select, another arbitration provider.</p>
                <p><strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>No Class Action Matters</u>. We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action and that the arbitrator may award relief (including injunctive relief) only on an individual basis. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial</u></strong>. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court: (i) except with respect to a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court, which you shall have the right to bring in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, you and Advva Deals agree that any Dispute may only be instituted in a state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California/Central District of California; (ii) you and Advva Deals irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution of such Disputes; and (iii) you and Advva Deals agree to waive any right to a trial by jury. You and Advva Deals agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Dispute Agreement and any Disputes.</p>
